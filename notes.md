# My first experience with health using GUT

It is amazing and the code ends up very short and readable for the component while the test suite explains what the code should do.

Test order: First run the tests that cover less dependent code. In my case i first want to test Health and then HealthPlus. This way the first error will lead me closer to where the real problem is.
- Also order each testcase in each script.

# Code

Instead of var with getter, only make a getter function.
