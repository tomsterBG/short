# TODO

## State machine

- Needs very good planning to be done properly in a widely applicable way that wouldn't limit me.

## Spawner and Spawnable

- Needs figuring out how to better do timed tests.

## Messages

- Needs better planning for cleaner code and a wider range of usecases. Also needs proper timed testing.
- It's just a message scene with internal stack and a helper method add_message("text", seconds), intended to streamline development of showing messages one after another for the chosen amount of time.
- The script should be decoupled from the style, so i can style the scene however i want and use the script for the functionality.

## Helpers

Helper functions in a global script.
- Test them.
