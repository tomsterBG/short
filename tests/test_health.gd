# INFO:
# Each unit test should build on top of the ones before it, for easier troubleshooting.
# TODO:
# - More shield testing, i'm not convinced in its robustness.
# - Testing can_die feels insufficient.
# - Test when all shields die and get revived.
# - Refactor tests. Break them up. Make them more atomic and focused on less things.
