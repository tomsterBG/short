# Godot short - Code shortening scripts for Godot 4.

# About

Visit https://github.com/tomsterBG/short and find README.md for more information.

Everything should be well documented so open the in-engine documentation for each script.

# Content

- Classes - Used without instances. Abstract, standalone, foundational.
- Components - Used like nodes in a scene.
- Specific feature implementations.
	- These are not used as widely, or have multiple implementations.
	- Feel free to comment out the `class_name`s of unuseful classes.

# Other

health.svg may look suspiciously similar to two other Godot assets in the asset lib, but i looked at them for inspiration and made this one myself in Figma.
